The hotel is regarded as a service institution. The quality of hotel service that can be provided is increasing as computer methods became more and more widely adopted in hotels. The computer can process information much faster than humans and can thereafter help to increase the flow of work through the hotel.
The software package named "A La Carte" provides facilities for admission, modification, deletion, issuing, returning, listing, and reports. By computerization, information can be retrieved readily with more clarity and absoluteness.
